# happytweet
The project is developed as part of the "Social Semantic Web" course at Bogazici University, for Fall 2014 semester.

Happytweet was live at happytweet.org, but not any more. It need major maintainance before becoming live again. I will make it live again, someday. Here's some screenshots from the earlier versions:
